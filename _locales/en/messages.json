The warning symbol is used because TORPEDO has found indicators in the email and / or in the web address that are also used in phishing attacks. You should therefore check this web address very carefully in this case. Examples of such indicators are e.g. For example: (1) the fact that the web server name in the web address is similar to a web server name in the green or blue list; (2) the link is a web address and it is different from the web address that is stored behind this link",
